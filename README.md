# OOP_Project

Here you'll find a little programm I made using the C++ language and Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm.
Download the files, look in the clienti.txt file to see or to add the users and passwords.
In the Filme.txt file you can see the movies stored, or erase and add new movies.
Open the CCentru.cpp file, build and run.
With the program,you can see available movies, rent, return or search for a movie.
